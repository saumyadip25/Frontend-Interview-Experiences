## Overall Experience

I got a feedback, that it was mixed feedback and they are not moving forward because their bar for this role was pretty high. I thought I did well because in round one I took one hint and in react question I could not complete the draw scenario and reset scenario because I had 30 minutes for Machine coding problem. For the second I could not complete the animation part but rest everything was good.
