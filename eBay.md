## Round 0: Online Coding Test on CodeSignal

**Duration:** 60 minutes

This round was conducted on CodeSignal with 4 DSA questions of varying difficulty levels - Easy, Easy-Medium, Medium, and Hard. I successfully solved 3 out of 4 problems within the time limit.

The first question was a straightforward string manipulation problem. The second involved array operations, and the third was a dynamic programming problem. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before attempting the fourth question.

Following this round, the recruiter contacted me to schedule an in-person interview at their office, which would consist of 3 technical rounds.

## Round 1: Face to Face Technical Interview

**Duration:** 60 minutes

**1. Introduction and Project Discussion**

The interview began with a self-introduction followed by a detailed discussion about my most recent project. The interviewer asked me to elaborate on the most challenging technical problem I had encountered and how I approached solving it.

**2. JavaScript Polyfills Implementation**

I was provided with a laptop and asked to implement polyfills for both throttle and debounce functions from scratch.

**3. React Infinite Scroll Implementation**

The next problem involved building a React component that fetches data from an API and implements infinite scrolling functionality. I chose to use the Intersection Observer API for this implementation, which the interviewer appreciated as a modern and performant approach.

**4. Frontend Performance Optimization**

The interviewer asked me to list all the frontend web optimization techniques I was familiar with. For each technique I mentioned, there were detailed follow-up questions to assess the depth of my understanding. Topics covered included code splitting, lazy loading, caching strategies, image optimization, and bundle size reduction.

**5. Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**

I was asked to explain how PWAs are created and the relationship between manifest.json and Service Workers.

**6. Leadership and Mentorship**

The interview concluded with behavioral questions about my approach to team leadership and how I mentor junior developers on my team.

## Overall Experience

**Result:** Rejected after Round 1

The rejection reason was quite unexpected and frustrating. According to the HR, the Member of Technical Staff position requires a minimum of 10+ years of experience as per their internal requirements. The HR mentioned they would reach out if any Senior Software Engineer positions become available in the future.
I expressed my concern to the HR that this experience requirement should have been validated during the initial screening phase itself, before investing time in the coding assessment and interview rounds.
