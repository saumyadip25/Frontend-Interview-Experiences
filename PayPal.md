## Round 4: Tech Specialization Round

**Duration:** 60 minutes

### Part 1: DSA - Binary Search
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Strategy:** Solved quickly to save time for React questions

### Part 2: React Internals (Conceptual Questions)
- Virtual DOM
- Reconciliation process
- Diffing Algorithm
- How React efficiently updates the UI

### Part 3: Pseudocode - Diffing Algorithm
- **Task:** Write pseudocode for the Diffing Algorithm
- **Approach:** Function comparing two DOM trees recursively (DFS-like)
- Compare nodes at each level

### Part 4: React Coding - Currency Converter
- **Task:** Implement a Currency Converter application
- **Requirements:**
  - Dynamic conversion based on dropdown selection
  - Update converted amount on user input
  - Handle state management properly

**Note:** Interviewer was supportive and helped debug failing test cases.

## Round 5: Bar Raiser Round

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Interviewer:** Senior Engineering Manager (15+ years experience)

### Topics Covered

#### 1. Introduction & Past Experience
- Self-introduction
- Deep dive into work at Fairmatic and Zendrive
- Technical depth and problem-solving approach

#### 2. Behavioral Questions
- Handling conflicts in teams
- Team collaboration experiences
- Decision-making in challenging scenarios

#### 3. Leadership & Mentorship
- Approach to mentoring junior engineers
- Ensuring technical growth in team members
- Aligning engineers with team goals

#### 4. Technical Ownership
- Scale and complexity of products built
- Technical decision-making process

**Note:** Before this round, the recruiter confirmed that all interviews were cleared and salary discussion was completed. However, one additional bar raiser round was scheduled a week later. I don't know why because I had heard they have 4 rounds of tech only.

## Round 6: Final Bar Raiser Round

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Focus:** DSA + JavaScript

### Question 1: Remove Minimum Substring for Unique Characters

#### Problem Statement
Given a string, remove the minimum-length substring such that the resulting string contains no duplicate characters. Maximize the length of the resulting string after removal.

#### Examples

```
Input: "aabcc"
Remove: "abc" (positions 2-4)
Output: "ac"
Reason: Any shorter removal leaves duplicates; length-3 is minimum

Input: "abca"
Remove: "a" (last character)
Output: "abc"

Input: "aa"
Remove: "a" (either one)
Output: "a"

Input: "abc"
Remove: "" (empty substring)
Output: "abc" (already unique)
```

**Result:** Implemented logic; 13/15 test cases passed. 2 hidden test cases failed due to debugging time constraints.

### Question 2: Deep Copy with Array Length Update

#### Problem Statement
Implement a function to deep copy an object with a special condition:
- If any key contains an array, append the array's length to the end of that array in the copied object
- Modifying the new object should not affect the original (true deep copy)

#### Example

```javascript
// Input
const obj1 = { a: 12, b: [1, 2, "a"] };

// Expected Output
const obj2 = { a: 12, b: [1, 2, "a", 3] };

// Deep copy validation
obj2.b.push(4);
console.log(obj1.b); // [1, 2, "a"] - unchanged
console.log(obj2.b); // [1, 2, "a", 3, 4]
```
